## ["doi2LaTex"](https://github.com/collectorhamster/writing-tools/blob/main/doi2LaTex.jl): A Julia-script for generating multiple references in standard LaTex code format based on DOIs.
How to use this script: create file named *"doi.txt"* and past doi of references into it. Ensure that *"doi.txt"* and *"doi2LaTex.jl"* are in the same folder. Run ```"julia doi2LaTex.jl"``` and you will see a file *"citfm.txt"*, which contains the LaTex code with standard format.
