## ["doi2LaTex"](https://github.com/collectorhamster/nH_dyn/blob/main/Fig1_code/Plot_Fig_skin.jl): A Julia-script for generating multiple references in standard LaTex code format based on DOIs.
How to use this script: create file named *"doi.txt"* and past doi of references into it. Ensure that *"doi.txt"* and *"doi2LaTex.jl"* are in the same folder. Run "julia doi2LaTex.jl" and you will see a file *"citfm.txt"*, which contains the LaTex code with standard format.
